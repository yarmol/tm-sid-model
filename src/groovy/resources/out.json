Hence the Party plays one or more roles with the enterprise or with another Party playing a role with the enterprise (indirectly). This is introduced to specify that the only party an enterprise would be interested in and will consider in its systems is a party playing a role (directly or indirectly). Roles would be represented by the PartyRole concept. Additional roles will be defined to cover the needs of the new digital ecosystem.\"Examples of roles played by Parties include those:•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of interest, such as competitors, sales prospects •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involved, such as customers, users, employees•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That provides value directly or indirectly, such as service providers, operators, cloud brokers, infrastructure providers, application developers.","packageUrl":"https://www.tmforum.org/Browsable_HTML_SID_R16.5/content/_3E3F0EC000E93D812BC602C5-content.html","classes":[{"name":"Description{name='null', comment='Represents a single human being (a man, woman or child).The individual could be a customer, an employee or any other person that the organization needs to store information about.
