* An information security "vulnerability" is a mistake in software that

* use it to violate a reasonable security policy for that system (this e 
* xcludes excluding entirely "open" security policies in which all users 
*  are trusted, or where there is no consideration of risk to the system 
* ). For CVE, a vulnerability is a state in a computing system (or set o 
* f systems) that either:    路 allows an attacker to execute commands as 
*  another user    路 allows an attacker to access data that is contrary  
* to the specified access restrictions for that data    路 allows an atta
