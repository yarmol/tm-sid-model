* The Resource ABE contains entities that are used to represent the vari 
* ous aspects of a Resource. These can be divided into four basic types  
* of entities.The first two, PhysicalResource and LogicalResource, are s 
* ets of entities that represent the physical and logical aspects of a R 
* esource, respectively. This is important to enable the SID to build a  
* set of reusable managed entities that can be used to model the physica 
* l and logical aspects of different types of Resources.The third type o 
* f entity, CompoundResource, is a set of entities that shows how to agg 
* regate PhysicalResources and LogicalResources into aggregate entities  
* that has physical and logical characteristics and behavior. This enabl 
* es designers to represent Resources that have physical and logical cha 
* racteristics and behavior as a single entity.The fourth type of entity 
* , Network, is a set of entities that shows how to represent networks,  
* sub-networks, network components, and other related aspects of a netwo 
* rk. This type of entity builds on the notion of a CompoundResource by  
* aggregating CompoundResources into a functional whole.
